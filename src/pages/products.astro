        <h2>The Best Sheets to Keep You Cool All Night</h2>
        <p>Sleep experts recommend choosing natural fibres such as bamboo that wick sweat away from your skin and dries quickly. The fabric absorbs sweat and brings it to the surface of the fabric to evaporate, keeping you cool and dry. With micro-gaps in the structure of the fabric, air can easily pass through the fabric allowing for adequate ventilation.</p>
        <p>Because bamboo fabric is breathable, thermo-regulating and moisture wicking, it can keep you cooler by up to 3 degrees in Summer and warmer in Winter.</p>

        <h2>Hypoallergenic and Safe for Sensitive Skin</h2>
        <p>Bamboo fabric deters dust mites and allergens. Bamboo is naturally antibacterial so bacteria cannot live well in bamboo fabric. Our fabric is made from 100% organic bamboo fibres that have been certified by OEKO-TEX® 100 Standard. This means that there are no harmful chemicals and heavy metals including AZO colorants and carcinogenic dyes.</p>

        <h2>Ultimate blend of craftsmanship, elegance and sustainability</h2>
        <p>We took organically grown bamboo fibres and woven it using an exclusive sateen weave. The result is durable, ultra soft fabric with a brilliant lustrous sheen. 300 thread count for bamboo fabric is as soft as 1000 thread count cotton sheets. Ours being 400 thread count sateen weave is far more superior - softer than silk and with a brilliance sheen.</p>
